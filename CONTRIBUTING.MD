## 🔱 Branching Strategy

We use a simple, clear Git branching flow:

* **main** → Stable production-ready branch
* **dev** → Development branch for upcoming features
* **feature/your-feature-name** → For new features
* **fix/your-fix-name** → For bug fixes

### Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with clear messages
5. Push your branch
6. Open a Pull Request (PR) into the **dev** branch

## 🧪 Running Tests (if tests exist in future updates)

Once tests are added, run them with:

```bash
npm test
```

OR

```bash
yarn test
```

Testing instructions will be updated as the test suite grows.

## 📝 Pull Request Guidelines

* Target **dev** branch
* Describe your changes clearly in the PR
* Reference related issues
* Add screenshots if UI changes
* Ensure code is formatted (Prettier recommended)
* Keep PRs small and focused
